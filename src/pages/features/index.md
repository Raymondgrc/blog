I'm feeling a lot better this week. I believe that I may have been getting burned out by the constant hours put into the project. This week was preceded by a week long break observing the Thanksgiving holiday. It was a relief.

During this week, I had a [whiteboard](https://youtu.be/QsxG40AEq5I) challenge. I also had a lot of work completed in the features. [1](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-Randomizer/pull/58)
