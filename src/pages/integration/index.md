This week, albeit a short one, my team and I produced mild success. We had a very difficult start.
Our first challenge was wrestling the django framework to let us expose its User class to an external API. This task was difficult because my team had referenced some code we worked with earlier and its use did not lend itself to us as easily as we would have liked. We spent a while tinkering with it, until we decided to reach for help from its author. His help led to a 16 line [revision](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-Randomizer/commit/29a2c47a3c93f1396850bd6337599e04bf493215)

Another pitfall that befell, or rather that we didn't expect was the difficulty of wrestling django to our desired effect. I feel that given the deadlines that we were under, we should have chose another tech like node/express. Django is not hard, I may not be comfortable with it now, but I know that if we had time to dive into documentation it would be much easier.

I also feel like our management needs revision, of some sort... We have forms for everything under the sun, we have meetings that are unnecessary, that could be expressed by a post and a brief Q&A. This sentiment is not unique to me, nor my group, neither my cohort. Our sentiment seems to be ignored, or dismissed...

But hey! We finally got to meet the head honcho today, nearly half way through this project. He took a quick look at our project, told us we missed the mark, said he'd get an instructor to assist us and promptly left. Well nice seeing you too!

I feel demoralized. Here's some [work](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-Randomizer/commit/1cac2674164bbb1dd39f751ad1d75e603e0569f5) I [did](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs8-Randomizer/commit/832edf54180df63b7096a30131874552e2a51867).
